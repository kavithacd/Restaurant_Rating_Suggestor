# Restaurant_Rating_Suggestor
Creating a Restaurant Rating Suggestor based on the review text entered by the customer

Based on a corpus of restaurant reviews, we build a "Rating Suggestor" to the customers as they enter review text. This is not a real-time suggestor model.

Technical aspects: natural language processing, word vectors, Boosting models (XG Boost and Light GBM)
